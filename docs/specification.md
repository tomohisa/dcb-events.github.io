!!! note

    This document defines the *minimal feature set* an Event Store must provide to be DCB compliant.

    While we introduce certain concepts and terminology, **implementations are not required to use the same terms** — as long as they offer equivalent functionality.

An Event Store that supports DCB provides a way to:

- **read** [Stored Event](#stored-event)s matching a [Query](#query), optionally starting from a specified [Event Id](#event-id)
- **append** [Event](#events)(s), optionally specifying an [Append Condition](#append-condition) to enforce consistency

## Reading Events

The Event Store...

- ... _MUST_ provide a way to filter Events based on their [Event Type](#event-type) and/or [Tag](#tags) (see [Query](#query))
- ... _SHOULD_ provide a way to read Events from a given starting [Event Id](#event-id)
- ... _MAY_ provide further filter options, e.g. for ordering or to limit the number of Events to load at once 

A typical interface for reading events (pseudo-code):

```{.haskell .no-copy}
EventStore {
  read(query: Query, options?: ReadOptions): EventStream
  // ...
}
```

**Note:** the `EventStream` represents some form of iterable or reactive stream of [Stored Event](#stored-event)s

## Writing Events

The Event Store...

- ... _MUST_ provide a way to atomically persist one or more [Event](#events)(s)
- ... _MUST_ fail if the Event Store contains at least one Event matching the [Append Condition](#append-condition), if specified

A typical interface for writing events (pseudo-code):

```{.haskell .no-copy}
EventStore {
  // ...
  append(events: Events|Event, condition?: AppendCondition): void
}
```

## Concepts

### Query

The `Query` describes constraints that must be matched by [Event](#event)s in the Event Store.
It effectively allows for filtering Events by their [Type](#event-type) and/or [Tags](#tags).

- It _MUST_ contain a set of [Query Item](#query-item)s with at least one item or represent a query that matches all Events
- All Query Items are effectively combined with an **OR**, e.g. adding an extra Query Item will likely result in more Events being returned

To differentiate the two query variants, dedicated factory methods might be helpful:

```{.haskell .no-copy}
Query.fromItems(items)
Query.all()
```

#### Query Item

Each item of a [Query](#query) allows to target Events by their [Type](#event-type) and/or [Tags](#tags).

An Event, to match a specific Query Item, needs to have the following characteristics:

- the [Type](#event-type) _MUST_ match **one** of the provided Types of the Query Item
- the [Tags](#tags) _MUST_ contain **all** of the Tags specified by the Query Item

##### Example

The following example query would match Events that are either...

- ...of type `EventType1` **OR** `EventType2`
- ...tagged `tag1` **AND** `tag2`
- ...of type `EventType2` **OR** `EventType3` **AND** tagged `tag1`**AND** `tag3`

```{.json .no-copy}
{
  "items": [
    {
      "types": ["EventType1", "EventType2"]
    },
    {
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
    },
    {
      "types": ["EventType2", "EventType3"],
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag3"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Events

A set of [Event](#event) instances that is passed to the `append()` method of the Event Store

It...

- _MUST_ not be empty
- _MUST_ be iterable, each iteration returning an [Event](#event)

### Event

- It _MUST_ contain an [Event Id](#event-id)
- It _MUST_ contain an [Event Type](#event-type)
- It _MUST_ contain [Event Data](#event-data)
- It _MAY_ contain [Tags](#tags)
- It _MAY_ contain further fields, like metadata defined by the client

#### Example

A _potential_ JSON representation of an Event:

```{.json .no-copy}
{
  "id": "9b57af26-f1d4-4882-a910-320b29b0fabf",
  "type": "SomeEventType",
  "data": "{\"some\":\"data\"}",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
   ...
}
```

### Stored Event

Contains or embeds all information of the original `Event` and potentially additional metadata that was added during the `append()` call.

- It _MUST_ contain the [Event](#event)
- It _MAY_ contain further fields, like metadata defined by the Event Store

### Event Id

Globally unique identifier of an event, potentially specified by the client

### Event Type

Type of the event used to filter Events in the [Query](#query).

### Event Data

Opaque payload of an [Event](#event)

### Tags

A set of [Tag](#tag)s.

- It _SHOULD_ not contain multiple [Tag](#tag)s with the same value

### Tag

A `Tag` can add domain-specific metadata to an event, allowing for custom partitioning.
Usually, a Tag represents a concept of the domain, e.g. the type and id of an entity like `product:p123`

- It _MAY_ represent a key/value pair such as `product:123` but that is irrelevant to the Event Store

### Append Condition

The Append Condition is used to enforce consistency, ensuring that between the time of building the Decision Model and appending the events, no new events were stored by another client that match the same query.

- It _MUST_ contain a `failIfEventsMatch` [Query](#query)
  - this is typically the same Query that was used when building the Decision Model
- It _MAY_ contain an `after` [Event Id](#event-id)
  - this represents the highest position the client was aware of while building the Decision Model. The Event Store _MUST_ ignore the Events before the specified position while checking the condition for appending events. _Note:_ This number can be _higher_ than the position of the last event matching the Query.
  - if omitted, no Events will be ignored, effectively failing if _any_ Event matches the specified Query

```{.haskell .no-copy}
AppendCondition {
  failIfEventsMatch: Query
  after?: EventId
}
```
